# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You'll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Technologies and Techniques Used

- **Express.js** - Web framework for Node.js
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL database
- **Mongoose** - MongoDB object modeling for Node.js
- **Validator** - Library for string validation and sanitization
- **ESLint** - Code linting with Airbnb style guide
- **Prettier** - Code formatting
- **Nodemon** - Development server with hot reload

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
